            Believe New York is a new 501c3 non-for-profit organization in New York City. We founded in the fall of 2018 by the collaboration of community activist Nicole K. Bulanchuk and artist Tyler S. Parrish. Believe New York restarted its services in the Summer of 2020 in the aftermath of COVID-19, with a new mission, new leadership and a new outreach model. 

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            Believe New York's mission is to improve the lives of all New Yorkers and beyond, and ensure all people regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, gender, and/or race can find and have access to the resources they need to survive and thrive.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We aim to help all individuals and families who need us, specifically individuals experiencing poverty, homelessness, mental illness, domestic violence, discrimination, unemployment, disability, loss, trauma, and/or any form of hardship that impacts their well being.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            With help from the Believers, passionate and hard working volunteers, and generous contributors, we are able to service and connect individuals and families to life-saving resources in all five boroughs of NYC. We aspire to stretch our outreach and services to beyond our incredible city, but first, there is much more work to be done in our home. 

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            Progress starts with you and continues with all of us. Please join our movement to make our city the best it's ever been.

            If you believe anything, Believe New York.
