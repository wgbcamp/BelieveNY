We strive to create a space that makes our volunteers and employees feel not only empowered, but also supported in their goals and health. In addition, we are always working to ensure equity, compassion, and cultural sensitivity in our approach towards clients. This comes from recruiting volunteers and clients from a wide variety of places and neighborhoods that embody numerous cultures and perspectives. We are continuously evolving to ensure our operations are consistent with our community needs.</div>

                    <div className="size18Font lineHeight30">Believe New York is made up solely of volunteers, including our leadership who are unpaid. Not only do we acknowledge that it is a privilege to be able to volunteer one time without pay but we are also compassionate and understanding when our volunteers need to take a step back because they can no longer dedicate unpaid hours.

                    When a person is involved with our organization, we pledge to do everything possible to ensure they feel comfortable, supported, and safe.

                    Our volunteers range from all races, gender identities, sexual/romantic orientations, physical limitations, and physical, mental, and psychological dis/ability status. Members of leadership, including Board members, are majority cisgender women, but currently include nonbinary/genderfluid, Queer, indigenous, Latinx, and first-generation-American members.

                    We also strive to curate our social media content to represent a wide variety of identities and expressions to reflect the diverse and vibrant communities we serve and support.
