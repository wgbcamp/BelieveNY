Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, isolated, or just need someone to listen, we’re here. Sessions are anonymous, nonjudgmental, and available via phone, Google Meet (audio only), or text message. Most people have ongoing sessions for about 3-6 months, but you are welcome to book only one session if you prefer.

During the intake, you may choose to use The Open Space only Track, or be enrolled in both The Open Space and <u className={custom.emailLink}>GetHelp</u> (Hybrid Track), depending on your needs and goals. It's totally up to you! You can also enroll in our other services at a later time, just let your Advocate know!

If you are in crisis, experiencing suicidal thoughts, or in immediate danger, please contact <b>911</b> or the <b>988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)</b> for immediate support.

We encourage you to choose the <b>Hybrid Track</b> during your intake to utilize both The Open Space and GetHelp services. Please let us know, and we'll work with you to connect to appropriate licensed services!
